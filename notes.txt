  - Days' configuration: information that one can obtain from:
    · The calendar
      · Its hour ranges
        · Its days

Pending:
  - Admin side:
    - Save the hour ranges (and therefore, the days) that the user have configured (ConfigureDays.tsx)
      - Decide which is the factor that indicates when to create an hour range / day and when to update it:
        How to decide:
          - If a day has the id field with a value, the update the day and
            - If the hour range has the id field with a value, the update the hour range
            - Otherwise: create the hour range
          - Otherwise: create the day
            - Create the hour ranges

  - Patient side:
    - Create an appointment
      1- Select hospital
      2- Select doctor that works in that hospital
      3- Using the calendar corresponding to that doctor and hospital show current's month calendar
        so that the patient can select a day.
      4- With a specific date selected, use the days' configuration and the existing appointments
        to show the hours available to schedule an appointment.
      
      Notes: when showing the month view (previous step of selecting a specific date) use the days'
      configuration and the existing appointments to show as selectable the dates that do not have
      all the appointments taken
  

Done:

    - Al crear hour ranges solo crea algunos. No se si se reproduce asi nomas:
      · RAZON: había dejado mal una parte del código y nunca se creaban realmente los hour ranges
